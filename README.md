# Paper-Collection
A collection of my papers from university with certain parts redacted.

## Bipedal_Walker_TD3 
My attempt at solving the BipedalWalker environment using a slightly modified version of the TD3 reinforcement learning policy.

## Deep_Learning_Paper
Using the AddNIST dataset to classify numbers with a deep learning classification algorithm, and using the CIFAR100 dataset to create a basic generative AI model which generates images based on given prompts. 

## Raisin_Classification
One of my proudest papers; using an artificial intelligence algorithm to classify varieties of raisins, based on the previous work of Cinar and Tasdemir (2020).
